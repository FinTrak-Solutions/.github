# FinTrack 3-Minute Demo Script

## Opening (15 seconds)
"Hello everyone! Today I'm excited to demonstrate FinTrack, our Rust-based personal finance management tool. FinTrack features a clean text user interface and helps users track their spending, manage budgets, and monitor their financial goals. Let me show you how it works."

## Authentication Flow (30 seconds)

For registration, I'll enter:
